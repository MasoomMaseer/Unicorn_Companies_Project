# Unicorn_Companies_Project
This Project was created with MySQL, and the results and insights were visually presented using Microsoft PowerPoint.
Through the analysis of data including over 1,000 Unicorn companies with valuations over $1 Billion, the goal is to identify a specific industry for a new business.
I have used SQL data manipulation clauses (CREATE DATABASE, USE, ALTER TABLE, UPDATE, SELECT) to structure and modify datasets.
Applied data transformation functions (STR_TO_DATE, REPLACE, REGEXP_REPLACE) for converting date formats and cleaning currency fields by removing non-numeric characters.
Utilized conditional statements (LIKE, CASE) for handling data formats (e.g., converting millions to billions).
